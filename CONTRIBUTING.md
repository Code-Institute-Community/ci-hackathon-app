# Contributing to Code Institute

We welcome contributions and assistance! If you want to know where to start, check out our [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Community/ci-hackathon-app/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc) page.

Sometimes we might forget something, so if you want to add a new feature that isn't currently listed in our Projects, that's great! Make sure to open a [New Issue](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Community/ci-hackathon-app/issues/new), with as much information as possible about the feature you'd like to work on, or needs improvements. Otherwise, feel free to contribute to any [open Project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Community/ci-hackathon-app/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc)!

## Projects & Issues

Since this is a new app being developed, we ask that contributors take a look at the [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Community/ci-hackathon-app/projects?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc) page for areas that we're looking for help and contributions. If you see an item that is not currently _**In Progress**_ by somebody else, be sure to tag yourself (`@your-username`) on the particular [Open Issue](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Community/ci-hackathon-app/issues?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aname-asc), to avoid duplicate work.
