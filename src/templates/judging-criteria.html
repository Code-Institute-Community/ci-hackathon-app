                <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Content</h2>

                <p>Content is the information provided on the site. It is not just text, but music, sound, animation, or
                    video – anything that communicates a site’s body of knowledge. Good content should be engaging,
                    relevant, and appropriate for the audience; you can tell it’s been developed for the Web because
                    it’s clear and concise and it works in the medium. Good content takes a stand. It has a voice and a
                    point of view. It may be informative, useful, or funny, but it always leaves you wanting more.</p>

                <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Structure and navigation</h2>

                <p>Refers to the framework of a site, the organization of content, the prioritization of information,
                    and the method in which you move through the site. Sites with good structure and navigation are
                    consistent, intuitive, and transparent. They allow you to form a mental model of the information
                    provided: where to find things and what to expect when you click. Good navigation gets you where you
                    want to go quickly and offers easy access to the breadth and depth of the site’s content.</p>

                <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Visual design</h2>

                <p>The appearance of the site. It’s more than just a pretty homepage, and it doesn’t have to be cutting
                    edge or trendy. Good visual design is high quality, appropriate, and relevant for the audience and
                    the message it is supporting. It communicates a visual experience and may even take your breath
                    away.</p>

                <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Functionality</h2>

                <p>Good functionality means the site works well. It loads quickly, has live links, and any new
                    technology used is functional and relevant for the intended audience. The site should work
                    cross-platform and be browser independent. Highly functional sites anticipate the diversity of user
                    requirements from file size and format to download speed. The most functional sites also take into
                    consideration those with special access needs. Good functionality makes the experience center stage
                    and the technology invisible.</p>
