<p>Hi {student},</p>

<p>Thank you so much for registering for the {hackathon}!</p>

<p>
    <strong>What does participation involve?</strong><br>
    You'll be assigned to a team, and work together building a project based on the assigned theme in a limited number of days. Don't worry if you have limited coding experience, all levels are welcome, and we encourage alumni to participate!
</p>

<p>
    <strong>What am I committing to?</strong><br>
    We recommend at bare minimum you dedicate a minimum of 8-10 hours over the duration of the Hackathon. You will be expected to actively contribute to your team, not just observe.
    Please check your calendar and confirm that you are available before registering, as dropping out really lets your team down, and the team will be one person fewer.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>IMPORTANT!</strong><br>
    Please ensure your Profile is up to date, especially the 'Latest Module' entry. This is vital for the team selection process. We try our best to balance the teams fairly, so it really helps you and your team to be accurate with your profile.
