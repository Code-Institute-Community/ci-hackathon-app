# The "updated" field isn't editable in admin. Neither is "submission" field.
# A custom method to auto-fill created_by fields can be made

# When it seemed relevant, I moved the ForeignKey field to another model and
# used the one listed in the schema as the related_name. I may have been
# erroneous to do so but it can be corrected easily.
# My reasoning is explained in comments above the ForeignKey fields.
